### Closest pair and clustering algorithms

+ Project Includes two implementations for computing the closest pairs of points in a data set: an O(n^2) pairwise checking algorithm and an O(nlog(n)) divide and conquer algorithm
+ See [tools.py](closest%20pair%20and%20clustering/tools.py)
+ Creates cluster objects for a cluster list based on lifetime cancer risk from air pollution data from U.S. counties
+ Using the faster closest pair algorithm, computes hierarchical and k-means clustering
+ Compares clustering methods in terms of efficiency, automation, quality
+ Produces 10 figures using matplotlib
+ Includes code to load data, compute a clustering and visualize results
+ See [load_and_print.py](closest%20pair%20and%20clustering/load_and_print.py)
